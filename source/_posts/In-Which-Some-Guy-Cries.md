Ok, so, men...

We have to talk.

I know, I know.  I'm not looking forward to it either.

You see, I sat down here this morning--this one rare, magical morning wherein circumstances briefly aligned so that I had a few moments to put thoughts onto a page--with every intention of hammering out a few paragraphs of cheap snark about edge-case personalities in the gun control debate (you know, like *People of Wal-Mart*, but with fewer pictures and at least eight repetitions of the phrase, "racking the slide"?).  It was going to be shallow, frivolous, narrowly topical, and only just maybe good for a few of the strained chuckles you cough up when your grandmother retells a joke from *Life In These United States* and only *sort of* mangles the punchline.  And I was **fine** with that.  An easy fluff piece, a quick vent for my spleen, and a low-impact workout for my atrophied editorial voice, after which I could be on my way, content with *Having Done Something<sup>TM</sup>*.  And so what if the finished product would have certainly come off sounding like Dave Barry with a severe concussion trying to read newsfeed posts from an ammosexual Facebook group?  Hell, I've published worse and called it a win.  

But I can't write that piece now.  

Now, instead, I have to talk about Jimmy Kimmel and his connection to dick jokes, mental health, democracy, human evolution,  and the eventual collapse of society as we know it.

I'll admit up front, I'm not a Jimmy Kimmel fan.  Until a few days ago, short of some vaguely-overheard watercooler chatter and maybe a half-glimpsed still fronting a video clip I didn't watch in a social media feed once in a while, I can't say I've even been *aware* of the man since *The Man Show*.  If pressed to generate an opinion, I'd probably said something along the lines of, "He wasn't as irritating as Adam Carolla."  So my curiosity was piqued recently when I began hearing references to a monologue he'd done following the Las Vegas shooting, one which seemed to be more than standard-issue chat show current events pandering bullshit.

So I watched [the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruYeBXudsds "Kimmel's Take on Las Vegas")

All politics and agenda and celebrity and showmanship aside, what I saw, what I heard, was a man in the midst of an existential crisis, overmastered by remorse, fear, confusion, and anger.  A man vulnerable in despair.  A man in pain, trying to make sense of senselessness.  I tend to be skeptical of celebrity emotional outbursts, because so many are--unfortunately, *must be*--so calculated.  This, though, felt genuine.  Felt *real*.

I was moved, and more than a little impressed.

Then I began to take note of the responses to Mr. Kimmel's unusual monologue, particularly the negative ones.

There sure do seem to be a lot of those.

A few fall into the predictable "I want my comedy back!" camp, folks confused and angry because one of the puppets in the TV stopped being funny and started talking about boring, serious shit for a minute.  I'm actually not too bothered by these.  I can relate.  Being able to turn my brain off for a few minutes is the main reason I watch TV, too.

A much larger and also-expected contingent whose objections are political:  they heard noises coming from the TV one night that sounded eerily like, "*something something* fewer guns *blah blah blah* no assault rifles *yadda yadda*" and all of a sudden their tighty-whiteys felt three sizes too small and they couldn't be sure whether the thudding in their heads was their racing heartbeat or the approaching jackboots of the Federal Gunsnatching Bureau, come to disarm them at last.  While I may not agree with these folks ideologically, I *do* get it.  Opinions are like assholes:  everybody has one, and it can be a *serious* drag to have someone else's shoved in your face unexpectedly.  Politics sucks like that.

But the remainder...    

The remainder of the detractors constitute a veritable Klassic Komedy Showcase featuring all the greatest hits from every middle-school boys' bathroom stall in history.  

In execution, they range from pithy one-liners featuring well-phrased and grammatically-correct sentiments such as "why don't you go somewhere else like a different country if you don't like our president and stop you're crying on tv snowflake" and "Nobody cares what you think you sound like a whining baby does Baby Jimmy want his bottle" all the way to [some surprisingly polished street art installations.](https://twitter.com/unsavoryagents/status/915989225631236096/photo/1 "Sabo's Critique of Kimmel")  

In effect, however, they all blend into a seamless idiot bray, as though a world full of monosyllabic trailer-park valedictorians and stunted, tittering man-children suddenly cried out in one voice, "**fuckingpansypussypolepolishercuckboyfaggotgunbabydouchebagvaginabitch!!**".  

And, really, what can you say to that, other than, "How long till the next asteroid?"

Let's be honest with each other here, shall we?  The people in this category, despite the fact that some mention the President, they're not in it for the politics.  They couldn't give less of a shit about ideology.  They've got their short hairs knotted because he cried on TV.

**Because he fucking cried.**

Which brings me at last, my fellow men, to the point of all this, which is that I need some clarification.

You see, what with a career and a family and the social fabric unravelling and the world quaking in the shadow of nuclear catastrophe, and also because it's autumn now, which means lots of end-of-season lawn care to attend to, to say nothing of the endless gift shopping and holiday party planning, I've just been *really* busy.  

And I know I've gotten a little out of touch.  

I mean, to be completely honest I can't even *remember* the last time I made it to one of the World Man Lifestyle Planning and World Domination Strategy meetings.  

So I'm sure I've missed a memo or two.  Was there a quorum call at some point?  

Did we, collectively, elect to go forward into humanity's future wearily humping away at the same denigrating non-philosophy of self as in ages past, the same ritualized starvation, neglect, and abuse of the male psyche that served our forebears so well, force-feeding each other the same viscid broth of antipathy, misogyny, homophobia, ignorance, biggotry, anger, insecurity and fear that has nourished generation after generation of bitter, frightened, ungrounded, under-realized perpetual adolescents struggling to carve out a sense of place and of self with a set of blunted and shabby tools, who, failing that, simply lash out, forever snapping and pissing on everything like neurotic dogs greeting an unexpected houseguest?

Is that what happened?

It'd be really great if someone could clue me in.

It's kind of important that I get it straight.  

Not for me, so much.  It's for my son.

Yeah.  I'm a father.  Beautiful little boy.  Most amazing experience of my life, just like everyone says.  And in many ways, I already need him at least as much as he needs me.  I didn't expect that.  But I can't forget my responsibilities.  Can't forget how much he'll look to me--how much he looks to me *already*--as a model of manhood.

My little boy is almost two years old now.  And if this is what we, the men of the world, have decided that manhood, that *masculinity*, looks like, then I am *way* behind on his regimen of emotional and spiritual neglect, and I've got to seriously get my ass in gear.     

And just so I can be *absoluely sure* that I haven't come all this way only to have the forest disappear behind the trees...

...I'll speak plainer.

If you are a man who simply cannot incorporate the notion of a crying man into the fabric of your reality, I'm talking to you.

If you are a man who is impelled to anger, scorn, ridicule, and resentment by the sight of another man--another *human being*--who, monentarily overwhelmed by grief in the face of the senseless destruction of innocent human lives, weeps without shame or apology, I'm talking to you.

If you are a man whose conception of manhood is so slight, so narrow and insubstantial, whose perception of his own masculinity is so brittle and frail, that they threaten to collapse utterly when confronted with a few drops of saltwater leaking from the eyes of another man, I'm talking to you.

And, without a doubt, if you are a man who could conjure no fouler slander, no bitterer curse to lever onto the head of a man who egregiously affronted you than to *compare him to a woman*, then, my friend, I am most *definitely* talking to you (and, incidentally, to your mother, and your sister, and your wife, and, most especially, to your daughter.  They must be so, *so* proud to have you in their lives).

If you are any of these men, then I address you directly, personally, and I speak with perfect sincerity, and from the depths of my heart, on behalf of myself and the rest of humanity who would very much like to turn the remainder of our dwindling reserves of time, attention, and energy to the business of carrying on civilization, when I say these words:

**Get. Fucked.**

Earnestly.

You see, we're quite busy at the moment.  We--that is, the human race--are rapidly running headlong up against some of the gravest challenges we've ever faced.  Social, Political, Economic, Ecological, Cosmological, Practical, Metaphysical.  You name a domain, there's a huge systemic crisis there waiting for us to confront it.  Hell, there's probably some music-related catastrophe ahead we haven't noticed yet.  And I hate to break it to you, my angry, resentful little snowflakes, but *you are one of the problems*.  For better or worse, you are not currently the most pressing problem, but you are, in addition to an embarrassment, a distraction. 

And I would really, *really* hate to find out that we had stood once upon the threshhold of the next phase of humanity's evolution, only to be brought down utterly by some overlooked detail because, at one blazingly critical moment, vast swathes of Earth's magnificent and deeply-ramified noosphere were consumed by memes about Jimmy Kimmel's estrogen levels.  

For what it's worth, I think Jimmy would agree.

## CODA

As usual, the obvious angle into any story, the most accessible face, is hardly the most worthwhile.  In course of the foregoing towering, apocalyptic rant, I deliberately chose to steer ruthlessly toward the lesser--though by *no* means inconsequential--issue of toxic masculinity and its impact on intellectual, emotional, and spiritual development.  However, as I've come to the close, I find I am uneasy walking away and leaving it thus.  Therefore, I will say, in as few words as possible, what I should hope is patently obvious:

The real, central question here is not, "Is it acceptable for a television personality to shed tears for the lives destroyed in a senseless mass murder?", but rather, "Why are there tears in so few eyes?"

For if any one of us can truly look upon cruelty untouched by sorrow, upon tragedy unmoved by grief, or upon evil, unstirred by anger, then he does little to commend his own humanity, and less to suggest his rightful place among an enlightened, prosperous, just, fair, and free society of human beings.
