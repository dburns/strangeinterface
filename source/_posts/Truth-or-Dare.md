Weighing in somewhere around the midway point on the list of words and phrases which make me question my continued enrollment in the human race is **Fake News**.  This would be so on the strength alone of its high esteem with the Chief Executive, but it infurtiates me all the more because, like so many soundbites and catchphrases, it obscures a nuanced but telling fallacy, one which revolves around the fact that even if you are *flawless* at detecting falsehood--you're not, by the way; sorry--you might not be able to find **truth** with both hands and a flashlight.  Learning to ignore fake news--an important skill, to be sure--does *not* guarantee you'll ever come within hailing distance of any *real* news.  

Therefore, I thought it would be an interesting exercise to begin our journey together by ennumerating a few items which I consider to be truth.  With luck, over time this will come to serve as both a contextual model of who I am and where I'm coming from, and also a conceptual roadmap of where I hope to go.  This should prove at least as valuable to me as to you, dear reader, so I ask  your indulgence.  That said, a couple of points to note:  

1.	This will, unfortunately, be a listicle.  Yes, I know.  The very lowest, most repugnant of literate forms.  Believe me, I wish 			I could think of a better way. 		   

2.	This will be a long post, and will likely grow over time.  Of all the things I do poorly, being concise is definitely one.

And so, without further ado...
