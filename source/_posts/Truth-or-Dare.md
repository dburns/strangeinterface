Weighing in somewhere around the midway point on the list of words and phrases which make me question my continued enrollment in the human race is **Fake News**.  This would be so on the strength alone of its high esteem with the Chief Executive, but it infurtiates me all the more because, like so many soundbites and catchphrases, it obscures a nuanced but telling fallacy, one which revolves around the fact that even if you are *flawless* at detecting falsehood--you're not, by the way; sorry--you might not be able to find **truth** with both hands and a flashlight.  Learning to ignore fake news--an important skill, to be sure--does *not* guarantee you'll ever come within hailing distance of any *real* news.  

We're becoming a culture obsessed with lies, and no one is willing to be straightforward about what is true.  Therefore, I thought it would be an interesting exercise to begin our journey together by ennumerating a few items which I consider to be *truth*:  unabashed declarations of ideas and concepts fundamental to my worldview and some commentary--brief or otherwise--on why I think thinking about them *matters*.  

As a would-be essayist (of sorts), a beginning of this nature poses unique challenges.

First, I'm putting my cards on the table right up front.  No equivocation, no hiding behind vagaries or slowly evolving my editorial voice to maximize audience engagement.  I'm leading straight off with raw ideas, pared down to minimal and easily-assailable targets bereft of the protective envelopment of a long, dense article.  I'm also taking hard positions--some presented none too gently--on sensitive issues.  For this I apologize not in the least.  But I cannot help but recognize that I may hereby make some enemies before I've had a chance to make friends.

Secondly, I've woven myself a quality dilemma.  If I do a sufficiently good job that the end product not only serves me as a useful incubator for future narrative, but also provides the reader with the sort of intellectual context I'm hoping to establish, then I will have, in effect, boiled some of what I consider my best and most important ideas down into handy pocket-sized morsels ready to be carried away or tossed aside, in either case without much thought, and without benefit of ever seeing them fully matured and elaborated as I would like.  If, on the other hand, I do a poor job, leaning on opacity and indirection in hopes of stringing you along, dear reader, then I will have produced, frankly, a worthless piece of shit that serves no one and nothing.

Nonetheless, I am enamoured of this idea of *context*, of true narrative built around a shared--or at least, freely exchanged--framework of ideas.  You see, the concepts that follow, and many more like them, experience and thought and feeling inextricably intertwined, make up the lense through which I interact with the universe.  It may well be that, without some understanding of this lense, this framing system of thought, no amount of skill  on my part as a writer (and it may turn out that that is what I have to offer:  *no amount of skill*) can completely bridge the gap between us.  It may be for want of this shared context and experience that we are so often so poorly equipped to understand one another, even though we speak of a common experience.  So perhaps the evolving document that follows can serve as a sort of fragmentary Rosetta Stone, a portable frame of reference, with the aid of which we might communicate the better, for better or worse.  

Or perhaps I'm just a lazy, pompous windbag who couldn't be bothered to scratch up a proper long-form essay on any particular topic, and chose instead to shotgun the reader with acidic opinionoids after the fashion of a pretentious, eggheaded Buzzfeed knockoff, and, along the way, had the unmitigated gall to try and pass off an insipid listicle blog post as some sort of lofty aspirational exercise in experimental prose.

I, for one, hope it's the former.  But if it turns out to have been the latter, then I can only say that I hope that you, too, admire gall.    

And so, without further ado, and in no particular order...

> Bias is not a unique characteristic of those who disagree with you.  

This one's easy.  Everyone you know, everyone you trust, everyone you interact with in any way, harbors and exhibits any number of biases, conscious or otherwise.  Your friends.  Your parents. Religious figures.  The elder statesman anchor on whichever news network you consider to be The Truth Channel.  Asshole bloggers.  Anyone who "just tells it like it is".  *Everyone* who uses the word "sheeple" or the phrase "Deep State".  **You.**  Yes, you.  Yes, *especially* if you're one of those rare extra-bright and judicious types who takes time to see every side of an issue clearly.

> Correctly identifying a speaker's bias(es) does not *necessarily* mean you've confirmed that the speaker is lying to you.  

And, as a corollary to this:

> Finding a particular piece of information to be in alignment with your own biases and predispositions does **not** guarantee the information is true.

When people talk about "listening critically", what they all too often  mean is "comparing what I hear to what I already believe, accepting as fact anything that matches, and discarding the rest as noise".  In the security realm, there's a handy rule of thumb:  A false rejection is an inconvenience; a false acceptance is a breach.  The same concept applies here.

> Journalism is an avocation.  Selling the news is a business.

The world is actually full of brilliant journalists, from beat writers for trade gossip rags to embedded war correspondents and everywhere in between.  Their labors are not just valuable, but absolutely crucial to an advanced, progressive, intellectually vital society.  The unfortunate practical reality, however, is that every commercial media outlet is driving an agenda.  *Hint:  It's money.*  Unless you're getting all of your news from the local community college Journalism Club newsletter, you are consuming the output of an editorial desk that is constrained by a business plan.  Every outlet has its own unique voice.  The smart and successful voices are crafted at *least* as much by strategy as by philosophy.        

And speaking of money...

> The Free Market is an efficiency optimization function, not a philosophy.

Market action at the coincidence of profit motive and consumer demand is blisteringly effective selection engine capable of reducing an arbitrary set of inputs to a single output that represents the (strictly locally, I suppose, in fairness) maximally efficient conversion of existing resources into wealth.  That's it.  That's all.  All the other trappings, such as price/wage establishment, patterns of action and reaction by competitive entities, distribution and allocation of resources, all these things are incidental and reducible to that one simplistic answer to that one narrow, limited question:  Is.  This.  Profitable?  

In short, a great way to determine who's best at climbing up trees and bringing back coconuts, but complete shit at helping you understand whether you'd have been better served felling the trees to build shelter.  An answer--even a good, correct answer--is worthless if you don't understand the question you're asking.

I will definitely have a great deal more to say on this subject down the road, but for now, I'll close this line of thought with a few additional seeds for future discussion:

> Having read Henry Hazlitt does **not** make you an expert in economics.  Or anything else.

> Quoting von Mises--even correctly--makes you kind of an asshole.

> Having actually *read* von Mises marks you as a rare and dedicated human being.  You're probably still an asshole, though.

And from capitalism, we move to social capital...

> No, the television is **NOT** to blame.

Well into this magnificent 21st century of ours, if you find yourself responding to complex, fraught, chaotic, emotionally challenging issues centered around tragedy, travesty, and human suffering by wondering--in a tenuous, charmingly emotionally vulnerable way--what role video games and violent television programming might have played, then, please--and I ask on behalf of all of humanity here--*please*, just stop.  Seriously.  I can *assure* you, you are not the sensitive hero you  imagine.  You are not courageously plumbing the depths of the collective psyche.  You are not displaying an elevated social consciousness.  You are a vacuous hole in the greater discourse, pretentiously regurgitating trite cliches for the pleasure of the sound of your own voice.  I can perhaps allow partial credit for "But what about the dissolute, disconnected, dehumanizing impact of predominately online communication?", if only because this at least speaks to phenomena of which we do not have entire *generations* of experience.  But, "violence on TV"?  Really?  If you don't have anything to say, there's no shame in remaining silent.

> Humans are  mostly-hairless, upright higher primates sometimes wrapped in cloth, not suits of clothing with disgusting animals nestled inside.

This one is short and sweet:  can we, as a culture, for fuck's sake dispense with our tittery, desperate, pubescent fascination-loathing schizophrenia with regard to our bodies and to sex?  Honestly, this is so fundamental to the nature of our organism that it scarcely seems possible that we could get it wrong, and yet, here we are...

> There is no Constitutional ammendment guaranteeing freedom from the consequences of one's actions.

For additional succinct and eloquent commentary on this point, see Randall Munroe's excellent [XKCD strip](https://xkcd.com/1357/ "Free Speech").    

And in a very similar vein:

> Freedom of religious expression does **not** guarantee your insulation against exposure to experiences incongruent with your religious inclinations.

And the corollary:

> Freedom of religious expression does not grant that others' non-participation in your religious observances constitutes persecution.

For color here--pun probably intended--see the infamous Starbucks red cup drama, storied battle in the so-called "War on Christmas" (or "War on Christianity", depending on who you asked at the time).  For those not familiar, the subtleties of the "issue" are...well, not at all subtle, really.  Allow me to illustrate.  

You see, in *war*, what happens is that people, many of  them innocent, die:  some for what they believe, some for what they represent, others just because they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Either way, death and suffering are the defining characteristics.  What happened on the Starbucks front of the "War on Christmas" was that patrons of a commercial foodservice enterprise were able to purchase overpriced coffee beverages in unmarked, solid-red paper cups whose surfaces bore no markings germane to the Christmas holiday.

Seems simple enough to me.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that, if you are someone who *sincerely* believes that your freedom of religious choice and expression means that others should default to at least paying lip service to your observances even when they might otherwise choose not to do so, then you fundamentally misunderstand the meaning of the term *freedom*, and you may also find that you've misunderstood the meaning of your religious observances, as well.
